# nist-parser

This repository provides helper scripts to process and filter the NIST20 library for downstream machine learning. We parse the sepctra from the .SDF file. 


To export after parsing:
```
tar -cvf nist_processeed.tar processed_data/
```

For a complete guide on purchasing the commercial library and download, see [here](https://github.com/Roestlab/massformer).
